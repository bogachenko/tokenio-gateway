# Integration tests

Integration tests live under this directory and are built only with:

```bash
go test -tags=integration ./integration/...
```

Rules:

- do not call production services;
- use local Docker Compose dependencies or in-process fakes;
- keep fake services deterministic;
- every added scenario must document the exact fake dependency it uses.
